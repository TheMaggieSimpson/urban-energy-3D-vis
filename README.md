# Urban Energy 3D Visualization

This is an example of visualizing energy data of urban buildings using [CesiumJS](https://cesiumjs.org) and 3D Tiles.

### Data Sources
- 3D Model: https://www.opengeodata.nrw.de/produkte/geobasis/3dg/
- Heat Demand data: randomly generated

### Demo

### The Steps
1. Get your 3D city model
1. Convert the model into 3D Tiles
1. Put the converted 3D Tiles in Cesium
1. Colorize the building based on your data

#### Get your 3D city model
The 3D city model used in this demo is the 3D model of Essen, a city in Germany, in CityGML format. It is taken from https://www.opengeodata.nrw.de/produkte/geobasis/3dg/
